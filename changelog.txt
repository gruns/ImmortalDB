 v1.1.0
================================================================================
Fixed: Cross-origin cookies are now stored with SameSite=None,
  Secure=true, as required. Other cookies remain set with SameSite=Lax
  and Secure=false -- the same defaults as if SameSite and Secure
  remained unset. Huge thank you to @zproxyz.
Fixed: Only add IndexedDbStore and LocalStorageStore if accessible.
Added: Cross-origin and same-origin tests.

================================================================================
 v1.0.3
================================================================================
Changed: SessionStorageStore is no longer used as a default data store with
  ImmortalDB.
Fixed: Support Server Side Rendering where the <window> global variable isn't
  available. Huge thank you to Krishna Sumanth and Kevin Miller.
Changed: For distribution, the main exported module in package.json is
  now the production-ready dist/immortal-db.js. Huge thank you to
  Donovan Edye.
